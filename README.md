### yummy-bot

Let's think about how you would like to run codegens, and actual bot.
Codegen - let's run in a env that is the same for bot.
Bot - in env that is close to my Chrome instance but not exactly the same.
For Bot Let's:
(codegen based on codegen-local.js)
1. Create kind of new profile
2. Transfer some cookies there to context
3. Spoof only user-agent (optional)
